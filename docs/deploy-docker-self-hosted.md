# Get Started With the NVIDIA RAG Blueprint

Use the following documentation to get started quickly with the [NVIDIA RAG Blueprint](readme.md).
In this walkthrough you deploy the NVIDIA RAG Blueprint with Docker Compose for a single node deployment, and using self-hosted on-premises models.
For other deployment options, refer to [Deployment Options](readme.md#deployment-options-for-rag-blueprint).

:::{tip}
If you want to run the RAG Blueprint with [NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://docs.nvidia.com/ai-workbench/user-guide/latest/overview/introduction.html), use [Quickstart for NVIDIA AI Workbench](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/rag/blob/main/deploy/workbench/README.md).
:::

:::{tip}
Looking for a simpler setup without Docker? Check out the [Containerless Deployment (Lite Mode)](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/rag/blob/main/notebooks/rag_library_lite_usage.ipynb) for a Python-only deployment using Milvus Lite and NVIDIA cloud APIs.
:::


## Prerequisites

:::{warning}
This deployment requires at least 200GB of free disk space to download and cache models, store vector databases, and run all required services. Ensure that you have sufficient storage available before you proceed.
:::

1. [Get an API Key](api-key.md).

2. Install Docker Engine. For more information, see [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).

3. Install Docker Compose. For more information, see [install the Compose plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/linux/).

   a. Ensure the Docker Compose plugin version is 2.29.1 or later.

   b. After you get the Docker Compose plugin installed, run `docker compose version` to confirm.

4. To pull images required by the blueprint from NGC, you must first authenticate Docker with nvcr.io. Use the NGC API Key you created in the first step.

   ```bash
   export NGC_API_KEY="nvapi-..."
   echo "${NGC_API_KEY}" | docker login nvcr.io -u '$oauthtoken' --password-stdin
   ```

5. Containers that are enabled with GPU acceleration, such as Milvus and NVIDIA NIMs, are deployed on-prem. To configure Docker for GPU-accelerated containers, install the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

6. Ensure you meet [the hardware requirements](./support-matrix.md).

## Clone the RAG Blueprint Git repository

You can clone the RAG Blueprint repository to create a local working copy that you can run and modify, with full git history and an easy way to update from upstream.

1. Confirm that Git is installed on your machine. [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone)
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want the project. [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone)
3. Clone the repository:  

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-Blueprints/rag.git
   ```  

4. Change into the cloned directory:  

   ```bash
   cd rag
   ``` 
 
5. Fetch all remote branches and tags (optional but useful): 

   ```bash
   git fetch --all --tags
   ``` 
 
6. Check out the latest release branch:  

   ```bash
   git checkout release-<latest-release>
   ```   

## Start services using self-hosted on-premises models

Use the following procedure to start all containers needed for this blueprint.

1. Create a directory to cache the models and export the path to the cache as an environment variable.

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.cache/model-cache
   export MODEL_DIRECTORY=~/.cache/model-cache
   ```


2. Export all the required environment variables to use on-prem models. Verify that the section `Endpoints for using cloud NIMs` is commented in this file.

   ```bash
   source deploy/compose/.env
   ```


3. (For A100 SXM and B200 platforms only) Run the following code to allocate 2 available GPUs before you continue with the following steps.

   ```bash
   export LLM_MS_GPU_ID=1,2
   ```


4. Start all required NIMs by running the following code.

   :::{warning}
   Do not attempt this step unless you have completed the previous steps.
   :::

   ```bash
   USERID=$(id -u) docker compose -f deploy/compose/nims.yaml up -d
   ```

5. Check the status of the deployment by running the following code. Wait until all services are up and the `nemoretriever-ranking-ms`, `nemoretriever-embedding-ms` and `nim-llm-ms`  NIMs are in healthy state before proceeding further.

     ```bash
     watch -n 2 'docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"'
     ```
    Your output should look similar to the following.

     ```output
        NAMES                                   STATUS

        nim-llm-ms                    Up 4 minutes (healthy)
        nemoretriever-ranking-ms      Up 4 minutes (healthy)
        compose-graphic-elements-1    Up 4 minutes
        compose-page-elements-1       Up 4 minutes
        nemoretriever-embedding-ms    Up 4 minutes (healthy)
        compose-nemoretriever-ocr-1   Up 4 minutes
        compose-table-structure-1     Up 4 minutes
     ```


6. Start the vector db containers from the repo root.

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/compose/vectordb.yaml up -d
   ```


7. Start the ingestion containers from the repo root. This pulls the prebuilt containers from NGC and deploys them on your system.

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-ingestor-server.yaml up -d
   ```

   You can check the status of the ingestor-server and running the following code.

   ```bash
   curl -X 'GET' 'http://workstation_ip:8082/v1/health?check_dependencies=true' -H 'accept: application/json'
   ```

    You should see output similar to the following.

    ```bash
    {
        "message": "Service is up.",
        "databases": [
            ...
        ],
        "object_storage": [
            ...
        ],
        "nim": [
            {
                "service": "Embeddings",
                "status": "healthy",
                ...
            },
            {
                "service": "Summary LLM",
                "status": "healthy",
                ...
            }
        ],
        "processing": [
            {
                "service": "NV-Ingest",
                "status": "healthy",
                ...
            }
        ],
        "task_management": [
            {
                "service": "Redis",
                "status": "healthy",
                ...
            }
        ]
    }
    ```


8. Start the RAG containers from the repo root. This pulls the prebuilt containers from NGC and deploys them on your system.

    ```bash
    docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-rag-server.yaml up -d
    ```

    You can check the status of the rag-server by running the following code.

    ```bash
    curl -X 'GET' 'http://workstation_ip:8081/v1/health?check_dependencies=true' -H 'accept: application/json'
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following.

    ```bash
    {
        "message": "Service is up.",
        "databases": [
            ...
        ],
        "object_storage": [
            ...
        ],
        "nim": [
        {
            "service": "LLM",
            "status": "healthy",
            ...
        },
        {
            "service": "Embeddings",
            "status": "healthy",
            ...
        },
        {
            "service": "Ranking",
            "status": "healthy",
            ...
        }
      ]
    }
    ```


9. Check the status of the deployment by running the following code.

    ```bash
    docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}"
    ```

    You should see output similar to the following. Confirm all the following containers are running.

    ```output
    CONTAINER ID   NAMES                            STATUS

    ```



## Experiment with the Web User Interface

After the RAG Blueprint is deployed, you can use the RAG UI to start experimenting with it.

1. Open a web browser and access the RAG UI. You can start experimenting by uploading docs and asking questions. For details, see [User Interface for NVIDIA RAG Blueprint](user-interface.md).



## Experiment with the Ingestion API Usage Notebook

After the RAG Blueprint is deployed, you can use the Ingestion API Usage notebook to start experimenting with it. For details, refer to [Experiment with the Ingestion API Usage Notebook](notebooks.md#experiment-with-the-ingestion-api-usage-notebook).



## Shut down services

1. To stop all running services, run the following code.

    ```bash
    docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-ingestor-server.yaml down
    docker compose -f deploy/compose/nims.yaml down
    docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-rag-server.yaml down
    docker compose -f deploy/compose/vectordb.yaml down
    ```


## Service Port and GPU Reference

For a complete reference of all services, their port mappings, and GPU assignments, see [Service Port and GPU Reference](service-port-gpu-reference.md)


## Advanced Deployment Considerations

After the first time you deploy the RAG Blueprint successfully, you can consider the following advanced deployment options:

- For information about advanced settings, see [Best Practices for Common Settings](accuracy_perf.md).

- To turn on recommended configurations for accuracy optimized profile set additional configs by running the following code:

   ```bash
   source deploy/compose/accuracy_profile.env
   ```

- To turn on recommended configurations for performance optimized profile set additional configs by running the following code:

   ```bash
   source deploy/compose/perf_profile.env
   ```

- To start just the services specific to RAG or ingestion add the `--profile rag` or `--profile ingest` flag to the code. For example:

   ```bash
   USERID=$(id -u) docker compose -f deploy/compose/nims.yaml --profile rag up -d
   ```

- If you make code changes and want to redeploy services, add the --build flag to your code.  For example:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-*-server.yaml up -d --build
   ```

- By default, GPU accelerated Milvus DB is deployed. You can choose the GPU ID to allocate by using the below env variable. For all service port mappings and GPU assignments, see [Service Port and GPU Reference](service-port-gpu-reference.md).

   ```bash
   VECTORSTORE_GPU_DEVICE_ID=0
   ```

- For improved accuracy, consider enabling reasoning mode. For details, refer to [Enable thinking](./enable-nemotron-thinking.md).


- NeMo Retriever OCR is now the default OCR service. To use legacy Paddle OCR instead, refer to [OCR Configuration Guide](nemoretriever-ocr.md).

- For advanced users who need direct filesystem access to extraction results, refer to [Ingestor Server Volume Mounting](mount-ingestor-volume.md).

- A single NVIDIA A100-80GB or H100-80GB, B200 GPU can be used to start non-LLM NIMs (nemoretriever-embedding-ms, nemoretriever-ranking-ms, and ingestion services like page-elements, ocr, graphic-elements, and table-structure) for ingestion and RAG workflows. You can control which GPU is used for each service by setting these environment variables in `deploy/compose/.env` file before launching. For a complete list of all services and their default GPU assignments, see [Service Port and GPU Reference](service-port-gpu-reference.md).

   ```bash
   EMBEDDING_MS_GPU_ID=0
   RANKING_MS_GPU_ID=0
   YOLOX_MS_GPU_ID=0
   YOLOX_GRAPHICS_MS_GPU_ID=0
   YOLOX_TABLE_MS_GPU_ID=0
   OCR_MS_GPU_ID=0
   ```

- If the NIMs are deployed in a different workstation or outside the nvidia-rag docker network on the same system, replace the host address of the below URLs with workstation IPs.

   ```bash
   APP_EMBEDDINGS_SERVERURL="workstation_ip:8000"
   APP_LLM_SERVERURL="workstation_ip:8000"
   APP_RANKING_SERVERURL="workstation_ip:8000"
   OCR_GRPC_ENDPOINT="workstation_ip:8001"
   YOLOX_GRPC_ENDPOINT="workstation_ip:8001"
   YOLOX_GRAPHIC_ELEMENTS_GRPC_ENDPOINT="workstation_ip:8001"
   YOLOX_TABLE_STRUCTURE_GRPC_ENDPOINT="workstation_ip:8001"
   ```
