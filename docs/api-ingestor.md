## Task Status Tracking

The `/status` endpoint returns detailed information about ingestion task progress. Use the `task_id` returned from `POST /documents` to monitor task completion.

### Task States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `PENDING` | Task is queued and processing has not started |
| `FINISHED` | Task completed successfully |
| `FAILED` | Task failed due to an error |
| `UNKNOWN` | Task not found or state cannot be determined |

### Progress Tracking

The status response includes progress metrics updated after each batch completes:

- **`total_documents`**: Total number of documents in the ingestion job
- **`documents_completed`**: Number of documents that have completed processing
- **`batches_completed`**: Number of processing batches completed

:::{note}
For more granular progress updates during batch processing, use the `nv_ingest_status` object described below, which tracks individual document extraction progress and updates more frequently than the batch-level metrics.
:::

### NV-Ingest Extraction Status

The `/status` endpoint response includes an `nv_ingest_status` object that provides real-time document extraction progress, updating more frequently than batch-level metrics. This is useful for monitoring individual document processing when polling the status endpoint:

- **`extraction_completed`**: Count of documents with completed extraction
- **`document_wise_status`**: Dictionary mapping each filename to its current extraction status

#### Document Extraction States

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `not_started` | Document queued, extraction not yet initiated |
| `submitted` | Document submitted to NV-Ingest for processing |
| `processing` | Document extraction is in progress |
| `completed` | Document extraction completed successfully |
| `failed` | Document extraction failed |

### Example Response

:::{note}
The example below shows key fields relevant to progress tracking. For the complete and current response schema, refer to the OpenAPI specification at the top of this page.
