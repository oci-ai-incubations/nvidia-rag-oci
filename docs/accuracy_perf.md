# Best Practices for Common NVIDIA RAG Blueprint Settings

Use this documentation to learn how to configure the performance of the [NVIDIA RAG Blueprint](readme.md) according to your specific use-case.
Default values are set to balance between accuracy and performance.
Change the setting if you want different behavior.


## Ingestion and Chunking

| `INGEST_DISABLE_DYNAMIC_SCALING` | `true` | Set to `true` to disable dynamic scaling. | - When disabled, provides better ingestion performance and throughput. <br/> - When disabled, more predictable resource allocation and processing behavior. <br/> | - When disabled, higher memory utilization as resources are statically allocated. <br/> - When disabled, less efficient memory usage when processing smaller workloads. <br/> |



## Retrieval and Generation

| Name                 | Default    | Description         | Advantages           | Disadvantages            |
|----------------------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| - `APP_LLM_MODELNAME` <br/> - `APP_EMBEDDINGS_MODELNAME` <br/> - `APP_RANKING_MODELNAME` <br/> | See description | The default models are the following: <br/>- `nvidia/llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5` <br/> - `nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-embedqa-1b-v2` <br/> - `nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2` <br/><br/>You can use larger models.  For details, refer to [Change the Inference or Embedding Model](change-model.md). | - Higher accuracy with better reasoning and a larger context length. <br/> | - Slower response time. <br/> - Higher inference cost. <br/> - Higher GPU requirement. <br/>  |
| `APP_VECTORSTORE_SEARCHTYPE` | `dense` | Set to `hybrid` to enable hybrid search. For details, refer to [Hybrid Search Support](hybrid_search.md). | - Can provide better retrieval accuracy for domain-specific content. <br/> | - Can induce higher latency for large number of documents. <br/> |
| `ENABLE_GUARDRAILS` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable NeMo Guardrails. For details, refer to [Nemo Guardrails Support](nemo-guardrails.md). | - Applies input/output constraints for better safety and consistency. <br/> | - Significant increased processing overhead for additional LLM calls. <br/> - Needs additional GPUs to deploy guardrails-specific models locally. <br/> |
| `ENABLE_QUERYREWRITER` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable query rewriting.  For details, refer to [Multi-Turn Conversation Support](multiturn.md). | - Enhances retrieval accuracy for multi-turn scenarios by rephrasing the query. <br/> | - Adds an extra LLM call, increasing latency. <br/> |
| `ENABLE_REFLECTION` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable self-reflection. For details, refer to [Self-Reflection Support](self-reflection.md). | - Can improve the response quality by refining intermediate retrieval and final LLM output. <br/> | - Significantly higher latency due to multiple iterations of LLM model call. <br/> - You might need to deploy a separate judge LLM model, increasing GPU requirement. <br/> |
| `ENABLE_RERANKER`    | `true` | Set to `true` to use the reranking model.    | - Improves accuracy by selecting better documents for response generation. <br/> | - Increases latency due to additional processing. <br/> - Additional hardware requirements for self-hosted on premises deployment. <br/>   |
| `ENABLE_VLM_INFERENCE` | `false`    | Set to `true` to use the Vision-Language Model (VLM) for response generation. For details, refer to [VLM for Generation](vlm.md).  | - Enables analysis of retrieved images alongside text for richer, multimodal responses. <br/> - Can process up to 4 images per citation. <br/> - Useful for document Q&A, visual search, and multimodal chatbots. <br/> | - Requires additional GPU resources for VLM model deployment. <br/> - Increases latency due to image processing. <br/> |
| Reasoning in `llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b-v1.5` | `/no_think` | Use `/think` to enable reasoning. For details, refer to [Enable Reasoning](enable-nemotron-thinking.md). | - Improves response quality through enhanced reasoning capabilities. <br/> - Yields more precise responses. The default model is verbose and works best with reasoning enabled. <br/> | - Can increase response latency due to additional thinking process. <br/> - Can increase token usage and computational overhead. <br/> |
| `RERANKER_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD` | `0.0` | Filters out retrieved chunks if reranker relevance is lower than this threshold. We recommend that you set this value between `0.3` and `0.5` to balance quality and coverage. For details, refer to [Use the Python Package](python-client.md). | - Faster retrieval by processing fewer documents. <br/> - Can improve accuracy by excluding low-relevance documents. <br/> | - Requires `ENABLE_RERANKER` set to `true` for effective filtering. <br/> - Might filter out too many chunks if the threshold is set high, causing no response from the RAG server. <br/> |
| `RERANKER TOP K` | 10 | Increase `reranker TOP K` to increase the probability of relevant context being part of the top-k contexts. | Increasing the value can improve accuracy. | Increasing the value can increase latency. |
| `VDB TOP K` | 100 | Increase `VDB TOP K` to provide a larger candidate pool for reranking. | Increasing the value can improve accuracy. | Increasing the value can increase latency. |

:::{note}
If relevant information is not appearing in responses, consider increasing `reranker_top_k`. This can occur when querying multiple collections (chunks compete for top-k slots) or when queries require information from many chunks. Adjust `reranker_top_k` based on the number of collections and query complexity, while balancing latency requirements.

## Advanced Ingestion Batch Mode Optimization

By default, the ingestion server processes files in parallel batches, distributing the workload to multiple workers for efficient ingestion.
This parallel processing architecture helps optimize throughput while managing system resources effectively.
You can use the following environment variables to configure the batch processing behavior.

:::{caution}
These variables are not "set it and forget it" variables.
These variables require trial and error tuning for optimal performance.

| Name                 | Default    | Description         | Advantages           | Disadvantages            |
|----------------------|------------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| `ENABLE_NV_INGEST_DYNAMIC_BATCHING` | `true` | Set to `true` to enable dynamic batch size selection based on the file types in each upload request. Batch parameters are chosen according to the most prevalent file types (for example, text-like files such as txt, md, html, json versus PDFs or images). Set to `false` to always use the fixed `NV_INGEST_FILES_PER_BATCH` and `NV_INGEST_CONCURRENT_BATCHES` values. | - Batch size is selected dynamically based on the most prevalent file types in an upload request. <br/> - For large numbers of small text files, a larger batch size is used for optimal performance. <br/> - Adapts to mixed or complex-file workloads without manual tuning per request. <br/> | - Batch size and concurrency vary per request, so behavior is less predictable than fixed batching. <br/> - You can set to `false` to disable dynamic batching and use fixed batch parameters instead. <br/> |
| `NV_INGEST_CONCURRENT_BATCHES` | 4 | Controls the number of parallel batch processing streams. | - You can increase this for systems with high memory capacity. <br/> | - Higher values require more system memory. <br/> - Requires careful tuning based on available system resources. <br/> |
| `NV_INGEST_FILES_PER_BATCH` | 16 | Controls how many files are processed in a single batch during ingestion. When dynamic batching is enabled, this value is used for non–text-heavy workloads; for text-heavy uploads, a larger batch size is applied automatically. | - Adjust this to helps optimize memory usage and processing efficiency. <br/> | - Setting this too high can cause memory pressure. <br/> - Setting this too low can reduce throughput. <br/> |
| `APP_NVINGEST_ENABLE_PDF_SPLIT_PROCESSING` | `false` | Set to `true` to enable parallel processing of PDF pages by splitting them into chunks. Most useful when ingesting a small number of large PDFs. Also available as `enable_pdf_split_processing` runtime argument in API requests to override this default. | - Reduces ingestion time for multi-page PDFs. <br/> | - Requires tuning `APP_NVINGEST_PAGES_PER_CHUNK` for optimal performance. <br/> - May increase memory usage. <br/> |
| `APP_NVINGEST_PAGES_PER_CHUNK` | 16 | Controls how many pages are grouped per chunk when `APP_NVINGEST_ENABLE_PDF_SPLIT_PROCESSING` is enabled. Smaller chunks = more parallelism but more overhead. Also available as `pdf_split_processing_options.pages_per_chunk` runtime argument in API requests to override this default. | - Smaller values increase parallelism. <br/> - Larger values reduce overhead. <br/> | - Requires tuning based on PDF sizes and available resources. <br/> |

:::{tip}
For optimal resource utilization, `NV_INGEST_CONCURRENT_BATCHES` times `NV_INGEST_FILES_PER_BATCH` should approximately equal `MAX_INGEST_PROCESS_WORKERS`.
